This is me teaching myself to use Clojure by writing a library to interface with timetric.com.

It's all freely licensed (BSD 3-clause, see LICENSE) so feel free to steal any and all of it, but take it with a pinch of salt, I'm no Clojure expert!

The main library file is timetric.clj, which exposes functions within the 'timetric' namespace. There's only one interesting function in there at the moment, 'get-series', which given auth credentials & a URL will return a timeseries object (consisting of a list of Date/value pairs).

There is a driver program in driver.clj to illustrate usage; you will need to insert your own API token credentials before use.

Usage should be obvious.
